1. Created a new branch
>>git checkout -b new_branch

2. 
>>touch new_branch_text.txt

3. 
>>git add new_branch_text.txt
>>git commit -m "new branch txt file"

4.
>>git push -u origin new_branch

5. delete a branch remote
git branch -d <branch-name>
git branch -D <branch-name> #for unmerged branches

6. delete branch remote
git push origin --delete <branch-name>

7. 
The reason you're seeing all the files from master in your new branch is that when you created the branch (e.g., new_branch), it was created based on the current state of master (or whichever branch you were on at the time).

In Git, when you create a new branch using:

git checkout -b new_branch

8. Create a new branch without inheriting from master:

You can create an orphan branch, which starts with no history or files:
git checkout --orphan new_branch
git rm -rf .
